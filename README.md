For example,  
like this.
 
You'll need an empty line between a paragraph and any following markdown construct, such as an ordered or unordered list, for that to be rendered. Like this:
 
* Item 1
* Item 2


*Italic characters* 
_Italic characters_
**bold characters**
__bold characters__


* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
    * Item 3a
    * Item 3b
    * Item 3c

Introducing my quote:
  
> Neque porro quisquam est qui 
> dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, 
> consectetur, adipisci velit...


Use the backtick to refer to a `function()`.
  
There is a literal ``backtick (`)`` here.


Indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. Alternatively, you can also use 3 backtick quote marks before and after the block, like this:
 
``` 
Text to appear as a code block.
``` 
 
Within a code block, ampersands (&) and angle brackets (< and >)are automatically converted into HTML entities.
 
This is a normal paragraph:
    This is a code block.
    With multiple lines.
